2018 Summer Internship at Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI), Chennai,  Tamil Nadu, India 

Guide: Dr. K. V. Subrahmanyam

This project aims to build an Generative Adversial Network (GAN) to generate and classify western classical music created by piano notes. 

Given a few starting notes as input, an RNN(the generator) generates a sequence of notes which are labelled by a (pre-trained) classifier(the discriminator) with an accuracy of about 94%.  

This repository consists of the processed and unprocessed version of test/training data for the classifier,and code for training the classifier and the neural network.
