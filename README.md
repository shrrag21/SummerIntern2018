This project aims to build an Generative Adversial Network (GAN) to generate and classify the music created using piano notes. 

An RNN creates a sequence of notes when given a few starting notes and a (pre-trained) classifier labels(Accuracy of 94%) it as 'good' or 'bad'.  

This repository consists of the processed and unprocessed version of test/training data for the classifier,and code for training the classifier and the neural network.
